# Database-Project1

This was a project that I did in college. We had to take a csv file and sort through it for any innacuracies. We would then insert it into a .bin file in a sorted order. The second program that I attached would look through the file for specific numbers of flights that you look for. I believe that the comments that I left in my programs should give enough info about how these programs work. Plug it into a command line and give it a try, I gave a small sample file for you to try it with.
